## Me

I'm currently a researcher at Microsoft Auotonomous Systems and Robotics Research.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2020, advised by [Mykel J. Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/).

These days I'm mostly working on enabling better data-driven simulations of physical systems.
My other research interests are multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and the "Problem Problem".
