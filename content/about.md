## Me

I'm currently part of the Founding Team at [Poly Corporation](https://withpoly.com/).
Previously I was a researcher at Microsoft Auotonomous Systems and Robotics Research where I worked on enabling better data-driven simulations of physical systems.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2020, advised by [Mykel J. Kochenderfer](http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/).
My other research interests are multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and the "Problem Problem".
